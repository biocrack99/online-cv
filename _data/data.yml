career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I’m a biomedical engineer with a PhD in visual optics and a passion for advancing technology in optics and ophthalmology. 
    Over the past years, I’ve built a multidisciplinary profile that blends optical design, technical support for ophthalmic equipment, 
    and hands-on experience in optical laboratories. I’ve also contributed to R&D projects in the biotechnology sector and developed 
    projection systems for 3D printing applications. My work is driven by the goal of creating precise, reliable, 
    and innovative solutions that support vision science, eye care technologies, optic and lighting design and assembly and alignment of optical systems  
education:
  title: Education
  info:
  - degree: PhD in Visual Optics 
    university: National University of Tucuman
    time: 2009 - 2018
    details: |
      In March 2018 I finished my PhD studies on topics related to peripheral aberrations and intraocular scattering  in human vision. The work consisted in designing and evaluating an off-axis scatter parameter that would be robust against normal periphery aberrations in healthy subjects. I also tried different autofocus techniques to decide which double pass image is optimal for optical quality measurements. During this stage I was able to acquire knowledge about visual and physiological optics with some basis in psychophysical methods. Also I obtained researcher skills such as paper writing, scientific dissemination and a critical point of view. This has given me a range of practical capabilities that will meet the needs of this role.
